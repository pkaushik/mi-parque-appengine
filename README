Who We Are:

Open Youth Networks, an outreach program at Columbia College Chicago's 
Interactive Arts and Media Department. 

Through mentorship and hands-on training, Open Youth Networks puts young 
innovators in intergenerational collaboration with industry leaders, artists 
and designers to create innovative software applications, games, and interaction 
media that educate, engage and inform. Open Youth Networks works to shrink the 
digital participation gap among females in the fields of social media, computer 
programming, software development and game design and prepare young women to 
successfully pursue college studies and careers in technology intensive fields. 
The program achieves this by creating innovative projects with a public purpose 
and by directly engaging students in a real life team-based experiences that 
apply technological solutions to real community and social challenges.
